# ✈️ YOUFLY - The Perfect Vacation
### A CPSC 455 Project
With just the click of a button, get swept away by the perfect vacation tailored just for you . 

## Project Description

Youfly is a **travel booking web application** that allows users to create a personalized profile by answering a series of questions. Based on their profile youfly will provide optimal travel destination recommendations and steps to book their travels directly within the site. Youfly is geared towards those eager travellers who have been going stir crazy over the course of the pandemic and are ready to travel with the reduced restrictions but don't know where to go first. Youfly makes the decision for our users by finding the optimal destination for each and every traveller. 

Youfly stores user profile data and their accompanying destination matching to provide optimal recommendations. Youfly also stores data around its travel destinations (key words scraped from Wikipedia pages) to optimize the destination and traveller matching. 

The objective of youfly is to use a Machine Learning Tensorflow model to enable optimal vacation destination matching, however if faced with time limitations our team can have preset locations based on the set answers the user makes to the series of profile questions.
