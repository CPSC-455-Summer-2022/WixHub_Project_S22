# ✈️ YOUFLY - The Perfect Vacation
### A CPSC 455 Project
With just the click of a button, get swept away by the perfect vacation tailored just for you . 

## Project Description

Youfly is a **travel booking web application** that allows users to create a personalized profile by answering a series of questions. Based on their profile youfly will provide optimal travel destination recommendations and steps to book their travels directly within the site. Youfly is geared towards those **eager travellers who have been going stir crazy** over the course of the pandemic and are **ready to travel** with the reduced restrictions but **don't know where to go** first. Youfly makes the decision for our users by finding the optimal destination for each and every traveller. 

Youfly stores user **profile data** and their a**ccompanying destination matching** to provide optimal recommendations. Youfly also stores d**ata around its travel destinations** (key words scraped from Wikipedia pages) to optimize the destination and traveller matching. 

The objective of youfly is to use a **Machine Learning Tensorflow mode**l to enable optimal vacation destination matching, however if faced with time limitations our team can have **preset locations** based on the set answers the user makes to the series of profile questions. 

## Project Task Requirements
Below are an evolving list of project requirements to develop a prototype version of youfly for CPSC 455. It will be continuously expanded on through GitHub's Project feature this summer as we approach August Demo.

### Minimal Requirements
- Simple modern design and easy to use interface 
- Straightforward and comprehensive profile creation process that maximizes retention
- Vacation Destination matching to user profile

### Standard Requirements 
- Interactive welcome page with walk through tutorial
- Multiple optimal travel destination options 
- Links to associated booking sites (air travel, hotel, excursions) for that particular travel destination
- Excursions within that travel destination that match individual profile

### Stretch Requirements
- Machine Learning model to ensure continuous optimization for travel destination matching
- Profile linking and grouping between multiple individuals/parties looking to travel together
- Direct booking capabilities through external booking site APIs
